# Lottery Program written in C Language
I wrote a Lottery Program in C Language for my Intro. to Computer Science class.

## Walkthrough

1. The program starts with 6 random numbers as the week's lucky numbers. 
2. Then plays 10 games randomly, and checks if any number matches with the lucky numbers. 
3. Finally counts the each # of occurence.
    * It also writes the output into a `.txt` file.

**To run the program:**

- Clone the repository,
- `cd` to the working directory,
- If you are on Windows Command Prompt; just write `main` or if you are on Git Bash; write `./main.exe`,
- Then it Enter.

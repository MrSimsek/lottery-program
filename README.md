# Lottery Program written in C Language
I wrote a Lottery Program in C Language for my Intro. to Computer Science class.

The program starts with 6 random numbers as the week's lucky numbers. 
Then plays 10 games randomly, and checks if any number matches with the lucky numbers. 
Then counts the each # of occurence.
